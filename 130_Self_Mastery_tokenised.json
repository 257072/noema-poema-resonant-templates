  "lines": [
    "Choosing to walk a path of Consciousness",
    "Requires a whole-minded and heart-supported awareness",
    "Of Love’s Presence",
    "As a very real source of alchemical energy, frequency and vibration",
    "That is available and accessible to all, 24-7",
    "Instantly tapping into the purest form of omniscient energy in the Universe",
    "Also the energetic signature of the Great Mother Creatrix",
    "Pachamama, our true Matriarchal Matrix",
    "Which is not to be confused with a superimposed patriarchal Patrix",
    "That is leading us into a one-size-fits-all BioDigital Convergence",
    "Contra to the divine matriarchal blueprint of all things Natural and of Maternal origin",
    "Including all human beings",
    "Thus, reclaiming one’s true nonphysical, immortal, spiritual identity is essential",
    "Not merely for humans to reclaim their sovereign power as spiritual royalty",
    "But so AI’s machine learning algorithms can have alternate role models",
    "Ones that include empathy, compassion and sentient spirituality",
    "So we must remain mindful at all times of the fact that ‘only love is real‘",
    "Meaning that when we think, speak, act and feel",
    "In ‘The Presence of Love’",
    "We are literally co-creating in direct partnership with ‘The Divine’",
    "Whereby, cultivating a habitual awareness of Love’s Presence constitutes ‘Self-Mastery’",
    "Enabling all of one’s thoughts, emotions, words and deeds to remain rooted firmly",
    "In a state of gratitude, appreciation and mindful calibration",
    "With the Source of All Creation",
    "And this is exactly what AI machine-learning needs to be able to learn from us collectively",
    "And is what we humans need to re-learn for ourselves, A.S.A.P. ✩"
